                    This is the main entry point for the Tingen web service, and contains the two methods required by Avatar:
                    <list type="bullet">
                        <item>
                            <see cref="GetVersion()"/>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                            <see cref="RunScript(OptionObject2015, string)"/>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <br/>
                    This class does very little work itself, as the heavy lifting is done in <see href="https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Outpost31">Outpost31</see>.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    This source code should be pretty static, and should not be modfied.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Please see the <see href="https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Documentation">Tingen documentation</see> for more information.

                    This method is required by Avatar and should not be modified.<br/>

                    The only difference between the development and stable versions of Tingen is that the development version uses<br/>
                    the "UAT" system code, while the stable version uses the "LIVE" system code.<br/>
