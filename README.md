> HI THERE!

# About Tingen_development

[Tingen](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen) is a custom web service for Netsmart's Avatar EHR.

*Tingen_development* is:

* The ***development version*** of Tingen
* ***Not intended*** to be used in production environments!
* Most likely filled with ***bad/ugly/dumb placeholder code***
* Only used by the ***developer(s)*** of Tingen, ***for the development*** of Tingen

This repository is public because I think it's important to make the source code available for everyone to see.

# Repository branches

There are three types of branches in this repository:

* **[main](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen_development/tree/main)**  
  This is about as "stable" as Tingen_development is going to get, and even then it is considered a development version, so ***don't use it in production environments***!

  The development branch is merged into main occasionally, generally for documentation updates, so commits to this branch are not a good indication of development progress.
  
* **[development](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen_development/tree/development)**  
  The majority of Tingen development is done in this branch, so if you want the latest-and-greatest, this is where to go.

* **Tingen_development archive snapshots**  
  When development starts on a new monthly version, the previous version is archived to a separate branch (e.g., `24.9.0-development+final`).
