# About Tingen-Development

This repository is used for active Tingen ***development***.

## You (probably) aren't interested in this repository...

Most likely this repository isn't going to be much use to you because:

* It's ***the development version*** of Tingen
* It's ***not intended*** to be used in production environments
* It's most likely filled with ***bad/ugly/dumb placeholder code***

This repository is public because I want everything Tingen-related to be transparent and reviewable.

## ...but you might be interested in one of these!

Check out:

* The [stable release of Tingen](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen)
* The Community Release of Tingen (coming soon) <!--[the Community Release](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-CommunityRelease). -->
* The [Tingen documentation](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Documentation)
