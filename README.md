# About Tingen_development

Tingen_development is where development for the [Tingen web service](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen) takes place.

## About this repository

This repository is used for Tingen ***active development***, and most likely this isn't going to be much use because:

* It's ***the development version*** of Tingen
* It's ***not intended*** to be used in production environments
* It's most likely filled with ***bad/ugly/dumb placeholder code***

This repository is public because I think it's important to make the source code available so everyone can poke through it, but it's not intended to be used on it's own.

# Repository branches

There are three types of branches in this repository:

* [main](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen_development/tree/main)  
  This is about as "stable" as Tingen_development is going to get. Even the `main` branch of Tingen_development is considered a development version, so it may contain broken/incomplete functionality!
  
* [development](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen_development/tree/development)  
  The majority of Tingen development is done in this branch.

* Tingen_development archive snapshots.
