> HI THERE!  
> 
> This is the **development version** of the [Tingen](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen) custom web service.

# About Tingen_development

[Tingen](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen) is a custom web service for Avatar.

Tingen_development is:

* It's the *development version* of Tingen
* It's **not intended** to be used in production environments!
* It's most likely filled with *bad/ugly/dumb placeholder code*
* Only used by the *developer(s)* of Tingen
* Is public because I think it's important to make the source code available for everyone to see

# Repository branches

There are three types of branches in this repository:

* [main](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen_development/tree/main)  
  This is about as "stable" as Tingen_development is going to get, and even then it is considered a development version, so it may contain broken/incomplete functionality!

  The development branch is merged into main occasionally, so commits to this branch are not a good indication of development progress.
  
* [development](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen_development/tree/development)  
  The majority of Tingen development is done in this branch.

* Tingen_development archive snapshots.  
  When development starts on a new monthly version, the previous version is archived to a seperate branch.
