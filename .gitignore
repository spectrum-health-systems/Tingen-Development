## .gitignore for Abatabadev
## b240517

## There are a few directories/resources that usually aren't committed to a
## repository that need to be committed for Abatabdev:
##
##  bin/
##  AbatabLieutenant needs the files in this directory to successfully
##  deploy Abatabadev.
##
##  log/, logs/
##  Abatabadev logs are stored in these directories with similar names, so
##  these are ignored to avoid issues.
